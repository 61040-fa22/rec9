# Recitation 9

This repository contains the solutions to exercises referenced in Recitation 9 (11/3/22). You can view the slides that accompanied these exercises [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h3K3NLD4gQWHwSdR6wO1NWawh-k8TMuf/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109426729812944918277&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Initial code is provided on branch `master`. Solution is provided in branch `solution`, with one commit for each part of the exercise.

You may want to refer to `public/demo.html` for a vanilla JS implementation demonstrating basic functionality of the todo list, and compare and contrast that to how we set up a todo list throughout Vue components.

## Setup

### Running the code
* Run `npm install` to install dependences.
* Run `npm run serve` to launch the `main.ts` file with live-reloading on every Vue component save
* Run `npm run build` to build the Vue app into static files that can be visited in your browser locally.
